# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Refactor the frontend repository to implement strict ESLint rules and resolve all linting issues.

## Key Knowledge
- This is a React/TypeScript project using Vite as the build tool
- The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Dependencies include React 19, React Router v7, and Lucide React icons
- ESLint is configured with TypeScript support and React plugins
- The project has a comprehensive component structure with pages, layouts, and contexts

## Recent Actions
- Analyzed the existing project structure and dependencies
- Enhanced ESLint configuration with stricter rules including TypeScript, React, accessibility, and import ordering rules
- Added additional ESLint plugins: eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, eslint-plugin-import
- Fixed several import order issues across multiple files
- Resolved all ESLint errors in the codebase
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
- Verified successful project build

## Current Status
All ESLint errors have been resolved and the project builds successfully. There is one remaining warning about an unused eslint-disable directive which can be ignored.
