# Backend API Fulfillment

## What Shipped
- Added persistent session storage so tokens issued during `/auth/login` can be renewed, fetched, and revoked server-side.
- Implemented `POST /auth/renew` to exchange a still-valid token for a fresh one, returning the updated session envelope expected by the frontend.
- Added `GET /auth/me` to resolve the authenticated user's profile via bearer auth, matching the latest `AuthService` contract.
- Added `POST /auth/logout` to revoke the current session token so subsequent calls fail with 401.

## Integration Notes
- All new endpoints live under the existing `/auth` prefix and reuse the `AuthSession` and `UserProfile` schemas already consumed by the app.
- When renewing, the previous token is revoked immediately; the client must replace it with the new value from the response.
- Logout returns 204 with an empty body; any follow-up call using the same token now yields 401.

## Testing
- Pytest isn't available in this environment (`pytest: command not found`). Please run the backend test suite after installing project dependencies or activating the correct virtual environment.
